# My Physics Notebook

Contains my textbook notes, problem solutions, etc. on physics and mathematics.
To read the notebook, go to [https://sqrtrae.github.io/physics](https://sqrtrae.github.io/physics).

To any wayward travellers, lost souls, or procrastinating fools who happen upon this repository, feel free to take a gander!
If you find any mistakes, typos, or other issues, please open an issue or PR!

Do note however that I _will not_ be accepting any requests to add **new** content (as in notes, problems, etc.).
The primary purpose of this repository is to be an aid as I study physics/mathematics subjects, and new content will only be added as I learn more!
