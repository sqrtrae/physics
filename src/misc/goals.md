# Goals

## Currently Studying

- Classical Mechanics
  - Using John R. Taylor's _Classical Mechanics_ as reference material.
  - This is more of me "re-learning" material from my undergrad education rather than learning something new. 
    As such, my progress on this will probably be slower, as I'm more keen on studying new topics and fields of physics/mathematics.
- General Relativity
  - Using Carroll's _Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity_ as reference material.
