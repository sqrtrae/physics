# 1 - Newton's Laws of Motion

## 1.1 - Classical Mechanics

```admonish info
This section is primarily a (very) brief history lesson in the development of classical mechanics.
```

The first formulation—Newton's three laws of motion—of classical mechanics was developed from the works of Galileo (1564 - 1642) and Newton (1642 - 1727). 
Two alternative formulations—Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics—were developed by Lagrange (1736 - 1813) and Hamilton (1805 - 1865) respectively.

## 1.2 - Space and Time

Each point $P$ of three-dimensional space can be labeled by a position vector $\vec{r}$. The position vector $\vec{r}$ is most naturally expanded by giving its components $(x, y, z)$ in the direction of three perpendicular axes; we define the three unit vectors $\hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z}$ to lie along these axes such that:

$$\vec{r} = x\hat{x} + y\hat{y} + z\hat{z}$$
